What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  A folder named .git is created.  This will contain the repository metadata.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The working directory is where checked out files are placed for editing.  The staging area stores data about what will go into the next commit.
