What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  A folder named .git is created.  This will contain the repository metadata.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The working directory is where checked out files are placed for editing.  The staging area stores data about what will go into the next commit.
  
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  Add only the files with the same logical change to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

  Create branches:
  - when you want to make changes while keeping the master untouched
  - when multiple developers will be making different versions, e.g., language-specific versions
  - when you want to add experimental features
  
  Branches:
  - will isolate different sets of changes
  - will leave you with a stable version that is untouched
  - will allow multiple developers to work on the repository
  
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  Diagrams graphically show you where commits where branched off, and the parents of each commit

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

  Merging two branches together results in the changes in both branches being integrated into one branch.  We represent the merge in the diagram the way we do to graphically show where the merge occurred, because we delete the name of one of the branches.
  
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

  Automatic merging is convenient when there are a lot of changes between branches, leaving you to do manual merges only when there are conflicts.  However, bugs may get introduced if the changes don't play nice when merged together.
